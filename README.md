# TRADING BOT   (version 0.2.5)


> A trading bot for trading on various exchanges. 

## **Description**

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THIS TRADES REAL MONEY. NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN

With this trading bot you can set how much of your crypto balance you would like to trade with. Change how long to give the bot to complete a trade sequence. ( i.e. 30 minutes, can be changed in config.json). It can be used to trade on the stable coin/token markets, it also sends notifications of any trades via telegram. Set which base coin/token to use. Set the profit target you want reach. You can have more than one instance running at a time. It trades using your API keys. You can set a stop loss (as a percentage). Change the chart timeframe the bot searches for trades on. Works on various exchanges i.e. Binance, kucoin. Please let me know what other exchanges you have tried that works. It calculates the best time to buy a coin/token based on a strategy (using Technical Indicators), and then sells for a profit. I use the Crypto Balancer to keep my portfolio at the levels I like. https://github.com/ebinum83/crypto_balancer . This app requires nodejs to be installed. Let me know what you think of this bot. Please fork, clone and edit.
